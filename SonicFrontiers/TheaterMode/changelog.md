## Theater Mode - Version 1.1
- Added the animation viewer. This allows you to view (almost) all of Sonic's animations individually or play them all consecutively.
- Added a minigame select. After crouching, start a parry to bring up the menu. Note that certain minigames cannot be completed due to a bug with Frontiers.
- Added language support. All menus are still in English, this just prevents other languages from seeing empty boxes.
- Cleaned up a lot of the code internally.
- Fixed a small issue where the hour wouldn't decrease when decreasing time by 30 minutes while Time Stop was enabled.

## Theater Mode - Version 1.0
- Initial release
