## Theater Mode - Version 1.3.2
- (Hopefully) the last patch needed. Tentatively fixed an issue where you could become unable to open the menu as other characters.

## Theater Mode - Verssion 1.3.1
- Fixed an oversight that could ruin save data.
- Properly enabled Theater Mode everywhere during Another Story.

## Theater Mode - Version 1.3.0
- Added support for Update 3.
- Enabled Theater Mode inputs at all times.
- Enabled on-the-fly character swapping for all islands. NOTE: Due to how they work, if you use them outside of Another Story, they'll have their default skills and cannot gain exp. To open the Theater Mode menu as a new character, hold RT (to go into the Pre-Boost idle animation) after crouching.

## Theater Mode - Version 1.2.7
- Actually updated the DLL this time.

## Theater Mode - Version 1.2.6
- Added support for Update 2.

## Theater Mode - Version 1.2.5
- Added an Advanced Settings menu, allowing for easier Photo Mode posing and menu navigation.
- Updated the "Bridging The Gap" and "Mysterious Door" cutscenes to properly hide the bridge and lava flow respectively.

## Theater Mode - Version 1.2
- Added support for Update 1

## Theater Mode - Version 1.1
- Added the animation viewer. This allows you to view (almost) all of Sonic's animations individually or play them all consecutively.
- Added a minigame select. After crouching, start a parry to bring up the menu. Note that certain minigames cannot be completed due to a bug with Frontiers.
- Added language support. All menus are still in English, this just prevents other languages from seeing empty boxes.
- Cleaned up a lot of the code internally.
- Fixed a small issue where the hour wouldn't decrease when decreasing time by 30 minutes while Time Stop was enabled.

## Theater Mode - Version 1.0
- Initial release
