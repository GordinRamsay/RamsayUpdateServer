## Combat DX - Version 1.2.2
- Fixed a bug with the Taunt mechanic that forced you out of combat.

## Combat DX - Version 1.2.1
- Properly implemented the changes from V1.2 (forgot to update most of the .pacs last time.)
- Added a Taunt mechanic. By crouching in combat for a brief moment, Sonic will perform one of four, randomly selected Taunts. These add to your Style Score at the cost of your Phantom Rush meter.

## Combat DX - Version 1.2
- Renamed the mod based on feedback.
- A companion mod specifically for Hedgehog May Cry can now be found on the GameBanana page for this mod.
- Faster Elder Koco leveling incorporated.
- Added extra Attack level scaling. You now gain more Phantom Rush based on your Attack level and your selected difficulty (at max attack, the multiplier is 1.49x/1.32x/1.24x on Easy/Normal/Hard). Defense scaling may be added in a future update, depending on feedback.
- Spin Slash adjusted. The attack now completes much faster but consumes roughly the same amount of meter.
- Corrected an oversight where a Double Multiplier bonus could reduce meter gain.
- Fixed a bug where Cyclone Kick wouldn't consistently add to Skill Links.
- Added a new UI pop-up when gaining an extra Quick Cyloop charge.
- Tower HP in "The Best Defense" quest has been reduced to account for Sonic's lower damage (20 HP > 10 HP).
- Pursuit Kick now stales faster (15/14/13/12/11 > 15/10/7/4/1).
