## Combat DX - Version 1.3
- Rewrote the code for Skill Links to be more manageable internally.
- Reduced the unlock requirement for Cyclone Kick.
- Rebalanced Super Sonic, Giganto and Knight.
- Super Sonic no longer gains Phantom Rush on hit.
- Super Sonic now regenerates Phantom Rush over time, based on difficulty, attack level and current Combo Rank.
- Super Sonic will now gain Style multiplier instead of a Rush multiplier from Skill Links.
- Getting hit as Super Sonic will now fully deplete the Phantom Rush gauge. On Normal and Hard, your Combo Rank will also be heavily reduced.
- Super Sonic will now earn a minimum of 25 rings from a Ring Bonus Skill Link.
- Rebalanced Super Sonic's Style requirements. Style Score is now earned faster but depletes faster.
- Super Sonic now gains Style Score from Quick Cyloop. Consecutive Quick Cyloops grant more score.
- Super Sonic now gains more Style Score from consecutive parries.
- Attempted to fix Style decay during Titan cutscenes/QTEs. This is not 100% effective, but it should help a bit.
- Reduced Rank notification spam during Super Sonic fights. There is now a 2 second window after changing Ranks before a new Rank can be granted.
- Lowered the damage on a few of Super Sonic's attacks (thanks to KirbyKrew661 for providing a starting point).
- Adjusted almost every move to inflict relevant Stun damage.
- Giganto can now be stunned after inflicting sufficient damage, droppping him to his knees for a few seconds.
- Decreased the Cyloop damage multiplier (2.5x > 2.0x)
- On Hard Mode, manual Cyloop is now disabled against Titans. Quick Cyloop still functions.
- Added a letterbox effect to Quick Cyloop cinematics during the Titan fights.
- (Mostly) fixed the bug where Giganto was immune to Quick Cyloop. The move will occasionally fail if you activate it inside a boss or during the wrong animation, but these are issues with the move itself and unrelated to Combat DX.
- Knight is less susceptible to Cyloop.
- Increased Wyvern's HP (50,000 > 75,000.)
- Increased the speed of Power Boost while chasing Wyvern on the red path so that it's actually faster than standard boosting (35 > 70.)
- (Hopefully) tweaked the Item Collection minigame on Chaos to accommodate lower damage.
- (Hopefully) fixed an issue where Super Sonic's Phantom Rush drain mechanic would activate too early.
- Tweaked some pop-ups to reflect the new Super Sonic changes. The text has only been updated for English to keep file size low.
- Slightly increased the maximum attack value from level ups (this is a base value that applies to every move in the game.)

## Combat DX - Version 1.2.2
- Fixed a bug with the Taunt mechanic that forced you out of combat.

## Combat DX - Version 1.2.1
- Properly implemented the changes from V1.2 (forgot to update most of the .pacs last time.)
- Added a Taunt mechanic. By crouching in combat for a brief moment, Sonic will perform one of four, randomly selected Taunts. These add to your Style Score at the cost of your Phantom Rush meter.

## Combat DX - Version 1.2
- Renamed the mod based on feedback.
- A companion mod specifically for Hedgehog May Cry can now be found on the GameBanana page for this mod.
- Faster Elder Koco leveling incorporated.
- Added extra Attack level scaling. You now gain more Phantom Rush based on your Attack level and your selected difficulty (at max attack, the multiplier is 1.49x/1.32x/1.24x on Easy/Normal/Hard). Defense scaling may be added in a future update, depending on feedback.
- Spin Slash adjusted. The attack now completes much faster but consumes roughly the same amount of meter.
- Corrected an oversight where a Double Multiplier bonus could reduce meter gain.
- Fixed a bug where Cyclone Kick wouldn't consistently add to Skill Links.
- Added a new UI pop-up when gaining an extra Quick Cyloop charge.
- Tower HP in "The Best Defense" quest has been reduced to account for Sonic's lower damage (20 HP > 10 HP).
- Pursuit Kick now stales faster (15/14/13/12/11 > 15/10/7/4/1).

## New Frontiers - Version 1.1
- Fixed issue where the combat system didn't activate when fighting Giganto
- Fixed an issue where the combat system broke when fighting Supreme (Sonic will no longer spam voice lines, meter will function as expected)
- Slightly increased the damage on your basic combo
- Lowered Bit Generator HP (these now die in 1 hit, as expected)
- Lowered health on the Umbrella enemy
