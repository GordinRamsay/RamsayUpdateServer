## Combat DX: HMC Companion - Version 1.2.0
- Added configuration options, similar to the main release. To configure the mod, simply adjust ComboConfig.lua in this mod's folder.
- Removed leftover Super Sonic code. If you wish to re-enable starting with a lower number of rings based on difficulty, you may re-enable it in ComboConfig.lua.
- **NOTE:** Until Hedgehog May Cry itself has been fixed to support Update 2, I cannot guarantee everything will work properly. If you encounter any issues, please report them on Combat DX's gamebanana page.
